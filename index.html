					<h3>1. Valuable Learning Tool</h3>
					<p>The most important thing about this is teaching programmers. No one cares about the junk that follows. This project should be focused on being a valuable learning tool.</p>

					<h3>2. Bug and Issue Tracking</h3>
					<p>We believe in the community. By documenting the operating system to a considerable level of detail, we encourage the community to point out any flaws or bugs in the design or code!</p>

					<h3>6. Development Tool</h3>
					<p>Back then, an operating system would be either developer friendly, or user friendly (Mac vs Linux). But this project aims to compensate for both seamlessly.</p>

					<h2>LiquiDOS: But what is it FOR?</h2>
					<img src="images/pic03.png" alt="Assembly code" />
					<p>The most asked question I get (and probably many hobbyist operating system developers) asked is "Why are you wasting your 
					time on this?" I personally belive that most, if not all software programmers should try a go at OSDevving, because you learn 
					a lot. However, the research portion of the task is very time consuming, but can very rewarding as well. So, LiquiDOS was a result 
					of curiosity, and a person with too much time to waste.</p>

					<h3>How Can I Contribute?</h3>
					<p>Currently, there is only one person working on the project, and that is me, the awesome Kevin. Now, I would LOVE if anyone 
					else shared the passion for hobbyist OSDevving (operating system development), and would like to contribute to the project somehow. 
					You can join by emailing me, but if you just want to make minor code changes, for the respository on GitHub, and create a pull request. 
					Again, I would LOVE if anyone currently is looking for something to do, and would like to contribute to this project!</p>
