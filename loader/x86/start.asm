; Declare constants for the multiboot header
ALIGNN   equ 1 << 0           ; align loaded modules on page boundaries
MEMINFO  equ 1 << 1           ; provide memory map
FLAGS    equ ALIGNN | MEMINFO ; this is the Multiboot 'flag' field
MAGIC    equ 0x1BADB002       ; 'magic number' lets bootloader find the header

ARCH_PAGE_SIZE equ 0x1000

; Declare a multiboot header that marks the program as a kernel. These are magic
; values that are documented in the multiboot standard. The bootloader will
; search for this signature in the first 8 KiB of the kernel file, aligned at a
; 32-bit boundary. The signature is in its own section so the header can be
; forced to be within the first 8 KiB of the kernel file.

; The multiboot standard does not define the value of the stack pointer register
; (esp) and it is up to the kernel to provide a stack. This allocates room for a
; small stack by creating a symbol at the bottom of it, then allocating 16384
; bytes for it, and finally creating a symbol at the top. The stack grows
; downwards on x86. The stack is in its own section so it can be marked nobits,
; which means the kernel file is smaller because it does not contain an
; uninitialized stack. The stack on x86 must be 16-byte aligned according to the
; System V ABI standard and de-facto extensions. The compiler will assume the
; stack is properly aligned and failure to align the stack will result in
; undefined behavior.
