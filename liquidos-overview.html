                    <h2>What is Abstraction?</h2>
                    <p>
					When you lean about computers, one of the first things you learn about is the mouse. There's this physical thing you move around 
					that causes a cursor icon to move on the screen. However, when you step down into the low level of the computer, you realise there's 
					a lot more to a cursor than you care to know; The operating system initiaizes a mouse driver that constantly queries the position of the 
					physical mouse. It then sends a message to the GUI server to draw a cursor icon at (x, y), and update the screen. The GUI server most likely 
					will write to a buffer which the video driver picks up and sets the pixel accordingly. However, even that explaination isn't the full story - you still 
					need all the tiny components and circuits (and then electrons) involved. The reason why we don't need to know all this to operate a mouse is something 
					called abstraction. Back then, when the computers are the size of a basement, people who operated the machines were engineers who knew everything 
					on how that machine works. However, with the introduction of home computers, people need not to know everything about how it works. This way of 
					thing in ideas (cursor) rather than the process (what happens underneath) is called abstraction
					</p>
                    <h2>LiquiDOS's Goal to Remove Abstraction</h2>
					<p>
					Why remove abstraction? Abstraction has helped us develop many new abstractions for the previous ones, and therefore allowing us to advance and develop 
					programs. However, the more abstraction layers there are, the narrower you're viewpoint will get. iPhones do not even want you to know what is happening 
					underneath. LiquiDOS wants to remove abstraction and show users what happens underneath, without them needing any prior knowledge of programming (think 
					art gallery). The project wants everyday people to know all the systems do is essential in everyday life, as the world is so deeply integrated with 
					technology. People think that there is some level of magic involved with computers, and that programmers are people that are hunched over their computers 
					doing some magical things. LiquiDOS wants to remove that sense of uncertainty under all the proccesses, and not to turn them into programmers - more to 
					<i>expose</i> them to programming.
