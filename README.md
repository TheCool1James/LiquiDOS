# LiquiDOS
[]:https://travis-ci.org/TheCool1James/LiquiDOS.svg?branch=master
A DOS-Style Operating System created from scratch. It uses GRUB to boot. Currently these are the only features implemented:  

1. Hardware interrupts (IRQs). Currently, only keyboard and PIT (timer) are supported. Added extendability for keymaps (if anyone wants to remap the keyboard, just look at the en_scan.h). Kprintf works too!  
2. GDT and IDTs. Exceptions are displayed on a pink error screen with a little Dalek ASCII art.  
3. Paging is revised and awesome
4. ACPI works! You can shutdown and reboot sucessfully. Working on handling a shutdown signal :smiley:
5. Added kernel heap + physical mm

That's all folks.  

## TODO

1. Make sure the ACPI shutdown signal works. (AKA port ACPICA)
2. Set up a initrd (ramdisk) for GRUB to load all the drivers and such
3. Set up a filesystem driver. I. NEED. ONE. BADLY.
4. Usermode, multitasking and whatnot... But not until the FS is all up and happy.  

I'm mainly aiming for the OS to be a "Lino Commando" thing (for now).
